      <p>Action: The team creates guidelines that are easy to use, meaningful, and address real-life issues that social media managers are experiencing. We use infographics, checklists, and tip sheets to make these best practices appealing and easy to use.</p>

      <p>Action: The team uses NARAtions as a digital training blog, making it both a place for analysis of our digital engagement and a training guide and repository for staff experiences. The blog features guidance, shares lessons learned, and offers models of social media success. We use NARAtions as place to share innovative ideas and report back on collaborations. The blog is available to NARA staff and the public.</p>

      <p>Action: The team supports communication and collaboration with the social media community across NARA, leads two-way communication with staff with monthly educational sessions on various channels (like webinars, calls, and Google Hangouts), reaches out via an email newsletter, and uses space on the ICN to consolidate information. We ask staff for feedback and act on what they say.</p>

      <p>Action: The team organizes organize lightning sessions and field trips for content creators to discuss and explore new ideas. We invite outside expertise to help us get inspired.</p>

      <p>Action: We increase visibility (and show the importance of social media) with managers and supervisors by sharing success and highlighting staff in a monthly report that shares little successes like retweets from famous people, stakeholder reactions to current archival projects, and numbers of people downloading eBooks and attending Hub events.</p>

        4.3 <strong>Give social media a seat at the planning table. </strong>Across the National Archives,<strong> </strong>we incorporate social media into all initiatives from the beginning, not as an afterthought. Currently, social media development is requested toward the end of project timelines. This limits our ability to imagine and plan for larger social media impact, partnerships, and audience outreach. By incorporating social media into early phases of creative development, we build in time for quality, depth, and execution for both large initiatives and smaller projects.

      <p>Action: To simplify the process of involving staff who aren’t content creators but come across interesting content in their daily work, we provide scanners in staff work areas. Staff can then instantly digitize and upload files to the catalog, which will provide fresh content on social media.</p>

      <p>Action: Develop easy ways for staff to identify a story to share on social media, such as working with the team or the embedded “staff reporters” to go from interesting nugget of information to published social media post.</p>

      <p>Action: &nbsp;A major hurdle in government social media is reliance on negotiated terms of service agreements. We work with NARA’s General Counsel to address the roadblocks and troubleshoot ways to make sure we follow the law without stifling our creativity.</p>

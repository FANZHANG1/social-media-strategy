## Goal 3: Grow Our Audience

<em>We reach more people, and diversify our audiences, by being present on popular platforms and publishing content that people feel compelled to share with their networks. We develop relationships with influencers and partners to reach more people in meaningful ways.</em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      <p>Staff reach the largest possible audience by inspiring people to talk about the stories in our holdings. Our staff are stewards to the history of democracy, our American government, and its citizens. Our documents inspire emotional responses that lead to social sharing.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> The teams focuses on becoming a leader in the GLAM (Galleries Libraries Archives Museums) community by creating a space on Archives.gov that serves as a resource for hashtags and other social trends for other cultural heritage institutions.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> The team addresses our photo policies within our public spaces. We need to improve our services, like wifi, to encourage digital sharing while visitors are in our physical spaces.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> The team defines a strategy for choosing hashtags that encourage personal connections and social sharing.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> The team uses reference desk statistics from across the National Archives to compile data on the most-requested items in our holdings. We feature these documents on social media to extend their reach to audiences who cannot visit in person.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> The team ensures that web content is easy to share on popular platforms with simple tools and buttons.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> Content creators connect with local communities to bring people physically to NARA locations through in-person events like Instameets, Tweet Ups, and Wikipedia edit-a-thons.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> We build on the expertise of our content creators who are successfully using social media to drive physical traffic to public programs. The team establishes a working group for these content creators to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
        pilot techniques to support and measure conversion of web-to-physical visits to our locations;
        </li>
        <li>
        think creatively about how NARA can encourage greater sharing of in-person visits via social media; and
        </li>
        <li>
        explore tactics like promoting hashtags on-site and in exhibit labels, provide screens that display geotagged images from visitors, and optimizing specific tools like Instagram, Twitter, Yelp, and more.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>The team studies trending news, hashtags, platforms, and current events and uses that information to determine what’s happening in the world that we can connect with<em>—</em>and what platform to connect on.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> The team looks for ways to tie our records to current issues. The team helps NARA locations host in-person events for local audiences centered on using our records in social media to &nbsp;inform modern dialogues about current events.</p>

We meet regularly with colleagues in the Office of Public and Media Communications to find out what is coming up and how we can help public affairs specialists tell stories on social media.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> The team works with the Office of Public and Media Communications to pitch traditional and news media on our social stories and campaigns. Public affairs specialists advise on what social content and campaigns interest traditional media outlets, and we ask them to pitch our campaigns to them. We create social media press kits that are built into the traditional press kits. We ask the Office of Public and Media Communications to pitch our social campaigns to social publications like Buzzfeed, Mashable, and TechCrunch.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> The team meet regularly with our Employee Communications staff to look for stories and give staff who aren’t on social media a new way to reach us with their stories.</p>

      <p><b>Action:</b> The team creates a Trend Team that &nbsp;keeps us up to date on the latest trends related to history, cultural organizations, government, and social media usage. The team includes staff with expertise in social media, marketing and communications, and technology. The team invites external experts to speak to staff about trends and hosts conversations with staff to generate ideas on the ICN.</p>

        The Digital Plan includes an easy-to-use worksheet for content creators to use to identify and track success measurements for their projects and posts. Staff share these worksheets on the ICN where everyone can use their experiences to improve their own campaigns and postings.

## Vision

The National Archives uses social media platforms to tell great stories; we connect more deeply with our audiences through conversation; we reach a wider audience and provide more opportunities for civic engagement; and we help our staff succeed by developing an employee culture that values and invests in social media skills. Data is a critical tool for understanding audience needs, and we use it to reflect on projects and guide decision-making.

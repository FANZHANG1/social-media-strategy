## Social Media Strategy FY17-20

We want to hear from you! National Archives staff, please tell us what you think about this draft of our new social media strategy. Our first stage is to incorporate feedback from our staff. Next, we will ask other cultural institutions to provide their suggestions. Finally, we will welcome comments from the public and update the strategy as a living document.
